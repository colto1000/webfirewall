# webfirewall

_WORK IN PROGRESS_

A IPTables-based firewall with a web application admin frontend, written mostly in Go and HTML.

## Usage
**From the root directory of this project, run the command: `go build -o firewall main.go`**

**...Then, run with: `sudo ./firewall`**

**Connect to the service at http://localhost:8082**

## _Notes_

- _You may try using the precompiled binary _(experimental)_: `chmod +x webfirewall_linux_amd64` and `sudo ./webfirewall_linux_amd64`_
- This project relies on Legacy IPTables modules, so you must first switch to Legacy IPTables if you're not already running it.
  - Run: `sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy`
- Some IPTables functionality (like Request Limiting) may or may not work based on what operating system you are running.
- You may have to create an SQL database to fit:
  - "webadmin:password12@tcp(localhost:3306)/webfirewall"
  - **Table Name:** "webfirewall" on SQL server on local machine's **Port 3306**, **Username:** "webadmin", **Password:** "password12".
- Install the required iptables modules, if not already installed. 
  - `sudo apt-get install xtables-addons-common xtables-addons-dkms`
- This project has been tested with Go v1.21.5 in Ubuntu 22.04.
